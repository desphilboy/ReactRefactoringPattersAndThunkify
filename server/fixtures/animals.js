    This is Desphilic counterpart of Scottish lake monster 'Loch Ness Monster'.
    In normal conditions pretends to be someone (your friend, PM in your project or a BA in your team).
    In attack mode grows (usually in the dark and when you are alone) and eats you.
    Is afraid of Upholstery needle because it will turn him into a dunky.
    RECOMMENDATION:
    Always have at least one Upholstery needle with you just in case.
